# Rein

> :warning: **This library is a work in progress!**

Reinforcement Learning algorithms written in [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/nx#readme).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rein` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rein, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

### Dependencies

This library has no external dependencies. However,
one should be able to run [EXLA](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla#readme), which is the default backend and compiler.

[Torchx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/torchx#readme) can also be used through the `REIN_NX_BACKEND` environment variable.

### Environment variables

- REIN_NX_BACKEND
  If set to "torchx", will use Torchx as the default backend. If "binary", uses plain Nx.BinaryBackend.
  Otherwise, will use EXLA as the default backend and compiler.

  For EXLA and Torchx, each have their own available environment variables as well.
